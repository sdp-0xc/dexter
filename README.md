`dexterServer.py` runs on the EV3.

Then move into the `DexterApp` directory and run

`python app.py`

This starts a dev server from Flask. Open the link specified (it all runs locally) and the EV3 should run the motors.

Note: Only tested on DICE. To run this on your personal machine, you need to log into the SDPRobots WiFi.
